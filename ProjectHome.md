This is my first time to produce a video game.

There are two key points about the implementations:

  * I have considered to use libgdx. However, this game is very performance critical, so I have to make this game all by myself. Even the TJA player on PSP seems lag some time. I have to use the OpenGL ES technology to improve the FPS.

  * The TJA format are quite complicated, even the TJA player on PSP cannot implement most of them.

The project donplayer-for-android http://code.google.com/p/donplayer-for-android/ seems to make a similar game like mine, and almost at the same creation time to mine.
